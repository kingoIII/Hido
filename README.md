markdown # LinuxVoiceAI A Siri-like voice assistant for Linux, built to handle natural language commands with smart speech recognition. Triggered by a key combo (e.g., `Super + S`), it processes commands like "turn off Wi-Fi" or custom tasks, running seamlessly in the background. This project showcases skills in Python, Machine Learning, NLP, and Linux system integration, with a clean UI and robust backend. ## Features - **Voice Recognition**: High-quality speech-to-text using `SpeechRecognition` with Google Speech API for natural language input. - **Natural Language Processing**: Intent detection with Hugging Face Transformers to understand conversational commands. - **System Control**: Executes Linux system commands (e.g., toggle Wi-Fi) via `subprocess`. - **Minimal UI**: Lightweight PyQt5 interface for status display and manual input. - **Background Automation**: Runs as a system service, saving state automatically with AI-driven prioritization. - **Portfolio Ready**: Modular code, documented, and deployed for professional use. ## Tech Stack - **Python**: Core language for logic, scripting, and integration. - **SpeechRecognition & PyAudio**: Captures and processes voice input. - **Hugging Face Transformers**: NLP for intent recognition and response generation. - **PyQt5**: Simple GUI for user interaction and status. - **Flask**: Lightweight backend API for command processing. - **Subprocess**: Executes Linux system commands. - **Linux Integration**: Configured as a system service with keybinding support (`Super + S`). ## Installation 1. Clone the repo: bash git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LinuxVoiceAI.git cd LinuxVoiceAI 2. Install dependencies:bash pip install -r requirements.txt Note: Requires `libpulse-dev` and `portaudio19-dev` for `PyAudio` on Linux. 3. Set up environment variables:bash export GOOGLE_CLOUD_SPEECH_CREDENTIALS=“path/to/your/credentials.json” 4. Configure keybinding: - Edit your Linux desktop environment settings (e.g., GNOME, KDE) to map `Super + S` to `python main.py`. 5. Run the app:bash python main.py ## Usage 1. Press `Super + S` to activate the assistant. 2. Speak commands like "turn off Wi-Fi," "open terminal," or "play my reggaeton playlist." 3. View status in the PyQt5 tray icon or get spoken responses via `pyttsx3`. 4. The AI autosaves session data (e.g., commands, preferences) in `data/sessions.json`. ## How It Works - **Speech Input**: `SpeechRecognition` captures audio via `PyAudio` and converts it to text using Google Speech API. - **NLP Processing**: Hugging Face’s BERT model classifies intents (e.g., “Wi-Fi off” → `nmcli radio wifi off`). - **System Integration**: Flask API handles command execution via `subprocess`, interfacing with Linux. - **UI**: PyQt5 tray icon shows status; clicking opens a command log. - **Autosave**: AI prioritizes saving critical data (e.g., frequent commands) to JSON, running in the background. ## Project Structure LinuxVoiceAI/ ├── main.py # Entry point, initializes app ├── voice_recognition.py
